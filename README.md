I wrote these files while I was attending *Computer's Architecture* held by Prof. Sterbini in Sapienza University of Rome.
The course concerned about:

- Computer Abstractions and Technology
- Operations of the Computer Hardware
- Operands of the Computer Hardware
- Logical Operations
- Parallelism and Instructions: Synchronization
- Arithmetic for Computers
- Parallelism and Computer Arithmetic
- The Processor Logic Design
- Pipelining
- Data Hazards: Forwarding vs. Stalling
- Control Hazards
- Exceptions
- Memory Hierarchy
- Caches
- Measuring and Improving Cache Performance
- Virtual Memory
- Cache Coherence
- Storage and Other I/O Topics
- Disk Storage
- Flash Storage
- Connecting Processors, Memory, and I/O Devices
- Interfacing I/O Devices to the Processor, Memory, and Operating System
